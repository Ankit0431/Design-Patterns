# Structural Design Patterns

## 🏛️ Overview
Structural design patterns focus on **organizing classes and objects** to form larger, more efficient structures. They help ensure that system components are **flexible and scalable** while maintaining clean and maintainable code.

This folder contains implementations of the following structural design patterns:

## 📂 List of Structural Design Patterns

### 🌉 Bridge
- **Use Case:** Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to evolve independently.
- **Example:** Cross-platform UI libraries, device drivers.

### 🌳 Composite
- **Use Case:** Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Example:** File system structures, UI component hierarchies.

### 🎭 Decorator
- **Use Case:** Dynamically adds behavior to an object without modifying its code.
- **Example:** Adding scrollbars to a window, logging frameworks.

### 🎭 Facade
- **Use Case:** Provides a simplified interface to a larger, more complex system.
- **Example:** APIs, software development kits (SDKs), database connection managers.

### 🕵️ Proxy
- **Use Case:** Acts as a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Example:** Virtual proxies for expensive operations, security proxies for access control.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Navigate to the respective pattern folder.
2. Review the implementation and study the example.
3. Apply these patterns in your projects to enhance flexibility and maintainability.
