# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the **Design Patterns Repository**! 🚀 This repository serves as a collection of commonly used **Design Patterns**, categorized into three main types:

- **Behavioral Design Patterns** 🧠
- **Creational Design Patterns** 🏗️
- **Structural Design Patterns** 🏛️

## 📌 Why Design Patterns Matter?
Design patterns provide **proven solutions** to common software design problems. They promote **code reusability, scalability, and maintainability**, ensuring that your software is not only functional but also **clean and efficient**. By leveraging these patterns, developers can create systems that are:

✅ **Modular** – Easy to extend and modify.  
✅ **Scalable** – Can accommodate growing requirements.  
✅ **Flexible** – Adaptable to changing business needs.  
✅ **Maintainable** – Easier to debug and understand.  

## 🏛️ SOLID Principles – The Foundation of Good Design
This repository follows the **SOLID** principles, which are key to writing robust and maintainable object-oriented code:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP) – Every class should have a single purpose.
- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP) – Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP) – Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP) – No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP) – High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
