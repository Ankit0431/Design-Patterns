# Behavioral Design Patterns

## 🧠 Overview
Behavioral design patterns focus on improving communication between objects. They help define **how objects interact and communicate**, reducing dependencies and making the system more flexible and maintainable.

This folder contains implementations of the following behavioral design patterns:

## 📂 List of Behavioral Design Patterns

### 🔗 Chain of Responsibility
- **Use Case:** Pass requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it.
- **Example:** Event handling systems, logging frameworks, and authorization filters.

### 🔄 Iterator
- **Use Case:** Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.
- **Example:** Navigating through elements in a list, tree, or database cursor.

### 🤝 Mediator
- **Use Case:** Centralizes communication between multiple objects to reduce direct dependencies.
- **Example:** Chat rooms, air traffic control systems, and UI dialog management.

### 📝 Memento
- **Use Case:** Saves and restores an object's previous state without exposing its details.
- **Example:** Undo/redo functionality in text editors, database transactions.

### 👀 Observer
- **Use Case:** Allows one object (subject) to notify multiple dependent objects (observers) when its state changes.
- **Example:** Event listeners in UI frameworks, stock market monitoring systems.

### 🔄 State
- **Use Case:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Example:** Traffic light systems, vending machines, and media players.

### 🎯 Strategy
- **Use Case:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Example:** Sorting algorithms, payment processing systems, and route planning in GPS.

### 📜 Template Method
- **Use Case:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm and allows subclasses to fill in specific steps.
- **Example:** Workflow engines, data processing frameworks, and game AI decision-making.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Navigate to the respective pattern folder.
2. Review the implementation and study the example.
3. Use these patterns in your own projects to improve design quality and maintainability.
