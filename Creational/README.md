# Creational Design Patterns

## 🏗️ Overview
Creational design patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**, increasing flexibility and reusability while ensuring that objects are created in a controlled manner.

This folder contains implementations of the following creational design patterns:

## 📂 List of Creational Design Patterns

### 🏭 Abstract Factory
- **Use Case:** Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Example:** Cross-platform UI toolkits, database connection factories.

### 🔨 Builder
- **Use Case:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Example:** Creating complex objects like documents, reports, or configuration files.

### 🏭 Factory Method
- **Use Case:** Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Example:** Logging frameworks, shape creation in drawing applications.

### 🧬 Prototype
- **Use Case:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object.
- **Example:** Cloning database records, creating game characters with predefined attributes.

### 🔒 Singleton
- **Use Case:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Example:** Database connections, logging instances, configuration managers.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Navigate to the respective pattern folder.
2. Review the implementation and study the example.
3. Apply these patterns in your own projects to improve design quality and maintainability.
